sxiv-patched
============

The sxiv image viewer (https://github.com/muennich/sxiv), patched
according to my personal preferences (default settings, and maybe more
in the future).

Also, because the sxiv Debian package in sid does not implement the bar
at the moment, I created a Debian package called `sxiv-patched` which
replaces the regular `sxiv` package. I just got sick of pinning such a
trivial package.

Building the package
--------------------

Just run `make package`.
